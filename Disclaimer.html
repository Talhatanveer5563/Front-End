        <h1 style="color: #5d001e;">Introduction</h1>
        <p>When using the internet for business, you need a clear written set of IT policies and procedures. This is important from both business and legal perspectives.

            For example, you need to let website visitors know how your site operates and how you might use their personal data. You also need to make clear the copyright of site content.
            
            At the same time, you need clear guidelines on how your staff should use the internet, email and social media, both for personal and business use.
            
            This guide gives sample wording for common internet-related statements and notices. It outlines the main issues that these notices should cover, which in turn will help you to write your own statements tailored to your business' needs.
            
            You can use and modify these sample policies and notices without infringing copyright.

                <h1 style="color: #5d001e;">Privacy Notice</h1>
                <p>
                    A privacy notice (also sometimes referred to as a privacy policy) is a key document which you must have if you collect, use or process personal data.

You must provide this document:

to inform people how you collect, process and use their personal data
typically at the point of data collection
in plain and clear language, accessible format, and free of charge
The law sets out the specific information you must supply to individuals and when.

How to write a compliant privacy notice?
If you collect personal data from the individuals themselves, you must include the following in your privacy notice at the time you obtain the data:

the data controller's identity and contact details
details of your data protection officer (if you are required to have one)
the purpose and legal basis for data processing
where the legal basis for processing is legitimate interest, what that interest is
where the legal basis is consent, the right to withdraw consent at any time
the existence of individual's rights (known as data subject rights)
with whom you will share personal data (named parties or categories of recipients)
whether you plan to transfer data to third countries and what safeguards will exist
how long you will keep the personal data for (or details of your retention criteria)
the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner's Office
if there is a statutory or contractual requirement for the data subject to provide personal data, and if so, the consequences of failing to provide data
if you intend to carry out any automated decision making (eg profiling), how you will make these decisions, their significance and possible consequences
In addition to the above, if you collect data from a third party (ie from a source other than the data subject), you must also include in the privacy notice:

categories of personal data concerned
the source of data (and whether it came from publicly available sources
Your privacy notice will usually sit on your website. You should link to it when asking people to eg subscribe to your newsletter, register with your service or provide you any personal information in any other way.
